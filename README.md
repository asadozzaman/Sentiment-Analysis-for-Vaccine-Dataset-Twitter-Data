Goal: Analyzing Sentiments of Users' Tweets

The objective of this project is to conduct sentiment analysis on users' tweets with the aim of gaining insights into the general sentiment towards the tweets. Through the utilization of NLP tools and machine learning algorithms, we will classify the sentiment of each tweet as either positive, negative, or neutral. Furthermore, we will compute sentiment intensity scores to measure the strength of the expressed sentiment.
